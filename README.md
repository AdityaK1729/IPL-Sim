# IPL-Sim
IPL match simulator entirely based on C++

To run, firstly update the schedule in the same format, put in match number in IPL.cpp, and update the initial points accordingly, then tun the IPL.cpp file, youll get results.txt and results.csv, both are essentially the same, but since I found easier to handle the txt file i used it. Then run DataHandle.cpp and then boom, you have your T2 and T4 probability calculated. NOTE- it doesnt check NRR as of now, and if its tie of points for top 2/top 4 it counts it for the probability, I'll try to change that in coming versions(if i am not lazy in the future)
